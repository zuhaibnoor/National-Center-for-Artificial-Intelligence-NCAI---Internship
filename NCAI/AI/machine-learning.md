# Machine learning

The branch of artificial intelligence in which computers use ldata and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

## Types/Approaches

There are 3 main approaches of machine learning:
<ul>
    <li><b>Supervised-learning:</b> In this approach we present the computer with example inputs and the desired outputs to learn a general rule. Like providing pictures of various vehicles labelled with thier type such as truck, car, van. The computer will learn the rule that whenever such object is detected it should be labelled respectively.</li>
    <li><b>Unsupervised-learning:</b>In unsupervised learning, no labels are provided to the computers and the computer is responsible for finding the patterns in the input for the desired outputs.</li>
    <li><b>reinforcement-learning:</b> In reinforcement learning, a computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). The program then provides feedback and rewards on the basis of which the performance or progress of the trained model is evaluated.</li>
</ul>
